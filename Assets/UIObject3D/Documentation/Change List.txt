v1.08
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- UIObject3D will now try to avoid calling DestroyImmediate() at runtime
- Added the 'Always Look At Target' property. If this is set to true,
  the UIObject3D camera will now be turned to face the target when the
  'Target Offset' values are used.
- Increased the min/max values for 'Target Offset' from -1/1 to -10/10.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.07
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- UIObject3D now cleans up more aggressively. It should no longer be possible 
  to have duplicate scene containers.
- Fixed an issue where, if UIObject3D was disabled prior to the completion of
  its setup process, it would never render the object.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.06
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a compilation error when building for Unity 2017.2 or higher
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.05
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- UIObject3D will no longer intercept mouse events when using a 
  'RotateUIObject3D' component using 'Constant' rotation mode (other modes
  will still intercept mouse events, however). If you require a solution
  which allows UIObject3D to intercept mouse events and still pass the on
  to a parent ScrollRect, you can use the following component:

V1.04
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- UIObject3D will no longer resize its texture/etc. immediately when its
  dimensions change, although whenever a full cleanup is triggered (e.g.
  when the scene starts, or when HardUpdateDisplay() is called manually),
  the texture will be resized.
  The reason for this change is that, as of Unity 2017.2, Layout Groups
  appear to be triggering OnRectTransformDimensionsChange() for UIObject3D
  instances constantly, which was causing UIObject3D to constantly resize
  its texture/etc., which was very expensive, causing massive performance 
  problems.
- Updated some method calls which were obsolete in 2017.2 to use non-obsolete
  methods
- UIObject3D will now have its image color set to transparent briefly during
  initialization, so as to avoid the 'flash' which is sometimes visible
  during this time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.03
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added the 'Override Calculated Target Scale' option which allows you to 
  specify a desired scale for the rendered object rather than using the
  value determined by UIObject3D calculations. You can use this to ensure
  that multiple rendered objects appear to be in the same scale.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.02
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed an issue with 'Render Constantly' which could lead to unexpected
  behaviour
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.01
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug which could cause Unity to crash when using models with rigs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V1.00
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Initial Release
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
